# Meat Grinder Campaign

## Introduction

A Meat Grinder campaign establishes a specific set of rules for the trench crusade campaign system to outline campaigns set in the nth Crusade period, where masses of troops on both sides crashed into each other, and the survivors were forced to fight for their lives. The campaign is set near the end of the campaign where supplies where scare and lives were cheap. 

## FAQ

**Q: This seems highly imbalanced, as `warband x` will surely dominate because of `these rules`.**

**A:** Yes. This is a work in progress and likely has glaring issues that will need to be addressed.

**Q: Won't the campaign games later in the campaign take an extremely long time to play?**

**A:** Yes.


## Playing a Meat Grinder Campaign

A meat grinder campaign follows the normal campaign rules apart from the following restrictions:

### Field Strength

In a meat grinder campaign you must always run the minimum field strength for the mission you are playing. The easiest way to think about this it to replace the Max Field Strength table with the below.

| Battle Number | Threshold Value | Minimum Field Strength  | Maximum Non-Basic Troops | Maximum Field Promoted Units |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1             | 700             | 10                      | 0                        | 1                            |
| 2             | 800             | 11                      | 1                        | 1                            |
| 3             | 900             | 12                      | 2                        | 2                            |

| 5             | 1100            | 14                      | 4                        | 3                            |
| 6             | 1200            | 15                      | 5                        | 3                            |

| 8             | 1400            | 17                      | 5                        | 4                            |
| 9             | 1500            | 18                      | 6                        | 4                            |
| 10            | 1600            | 19                      | 6                        | 4                            |
| 11            | 1700            | 20                      | 6                        | 5                            |
| 12            | 1800            | 22                      | 7                        | 5                            |

If you are ever in a position where you cannot field the required field strength your warband is crushed in the meat grinder and you must disband your warband per the existing rules for disbanding a warband.

### Warband Composition

Warband composition is restricted in a meat grinder campaign, outside of your required leader unit the majority of your warband (2/3, rounding up) must be basic troops. There are also restrictions on the amount of non-basic you can field , refer to the table in Field Strength.

Basic troops are:

| Faction                           | Basic Troops                                        |
| -------                           | ------------                                        |
| Heretic Legion                    | Heretic Trooper, Wretch                             |
| Trench Pilgrims                   | Trench Pilgrim                                      |
| Iron Sultanate                    | Azebs                                               |
| Principality of New Antioch       | Yeoman                                              |
| Cult of the Black Grail           | Hounds of the Black Grail, Grail Thrall, Fly Thrall |
| Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent | Yoke Fiend, Wretched                                |

Where a variant warband does not allow the valid formation of a warband that adheres to both this section and the field strength section you are not allowed to run that variant warband in this campaign type.

#### Field Promotions

This section replaaces the non-elite promotions section of the campaign rules entirely.

At the start of the campaign when constructing your list one unit receives a field promotion. The model gains the Keyword `ELITE`, it is moved to the `ELITE` section of your warbandâ€™s roster and it begins with 0 Experience Points. As the campaign progresses you will gain additional field promotions, see the 'Maximum Field Promoted Units' table in Field Strength.
