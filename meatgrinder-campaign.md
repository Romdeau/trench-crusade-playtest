# Meat Grinder Campaign

## Introduction

A Meat Grinder campaign establishes a specific set of rules for the trench crusade campaign system to outline campaigns set in the `nth Crusade` period, where masses of troops on both sides crashed into each other, and the survivors were forced to fight for their lives. The campaign is set near the end of the campaign where supplies where scare and lives were cheap. 

These rules are designed to expand on the `v1.3` version of the campaign rules.

## FAQ

**Q: This seems highly imbalanced, as `warband x` will surely dominate because of `these rules`.**

**A:** Yes. This is a work in progress and likely has glaring issues that will need to be addressed. If you find one please leave a Github issue =).

**Q: Won't the campaign games later in the campaign take an extremely long time to play?**

**A:** Yes.

**Q: What is the `nth Crusade`?**

**A:** This is my placeholder for if I ever decide to add some real fluff around this Campaign.

**Q: Can I use any of the ideas/concepts for this in my own campaigns?**

**A:** Sure, all I'd ask for is an attribution to [me]](https://github.com/Romdeau) and a link back to [this repository](https://github.com/Romdeau/trench-crusade-playtest/).

## Playing a Meat Grinder Campaign

A meat grinder campaign follows the normal campaign rules apart from the following restrictions:

### Field Strength

In a meat grinder campaign you must always run the minimum field strength for the mission you are playing. The easiest way to think about this it to replace the Max Field Strength table with the below.

| Battle Number | Threshold Value | Minimum Field Strength  | Maximum Non-Basic Troops | Maximum Field Promoted Units |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1             | 700             | 10                      | 0                        | 1                            |
| 2             | 800             | 11                      | 1                        | 1                            |
| 3             | 900             | 12                      | 2                        | 2                            |
| 4             | 1000            | 13                      | 3                        | 2                            |
| 5             | 1100            | 14                      | 4                        | 3                            |
| 6             | 1200            | 15                      | 5                        | 3                            |
| 7             | 1300            | 16                      | 5                        | 3                            |
| 8             | 1400            | 17                      | 5                        | 4                            |
| 9             | 1500            | 18                      | 6                        | 4                            |
| 10            | 1600            | 19                      | 6                        | 4                            |
| 11            | 1700            | 20                      | 6                        | 5                            |
| 12            | 1800            | 22                      | 7                        | 5                            |

If you are ever in a position where you cannot field the required field strength your warband is crushed in the meat grinder and you must disband your warband per the existing rules for disbanding a warband.

### Warband Composition

Warband composition is restricted in a meat grinder campaign, outside of your required leader unit the majority of your warband (2/3, rounding up) must be basic troops. There are also restrictions on the amount of non-basic you can field , refer to the table in Field Strength.

Basic troops are:

| Faction                           | Basic Troops                                        |
| -------                           | ------------                                        |
| Heretic Legion                    | Heretic Trooper, Wretch                             |
| Trench Pilgrims                   | Trench Pilgrim , Ecclesiastic Prisoner              |
| Iron Sultanate                    | Azebs                                               |
| Principality of New Antioch       | Yeoman                                              |
| Cult of the Black Grail           | Hounds of the Black Grail, Grail Thrall, Fly Thrall |
| Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent | Yoke Fiend, Wretched                                |

Where a variant warband does not allow the valid formation of a warband that adheres to both this section and the field strength section you are not allowed to run that variant warband in this campaign type.

### Field Promotions

> This section replaces the non-elite promotions section of the campaign rules entirely. The `Units That Cannot be Promoted` and `Limited Potential` sections are still in full effect, except where explicitly mentioned in this section.

At the start of the campaign when constructing your list one unit receives a field promotion. The model gains the Keyword `ELITE`, it is moved to the `ELITE` section of your warbandâ€™s roster and it begins with 0 Experience Points. As the campaign progresses you will gain additional field promotions, see the 'Maximum Field Promoted Units' table in Field Strength. You may also choose not to promote a unit, in which case you will have an open field promotion slot, which you may choose to use during the `Reinforcements` step of the campaign.

Where a unit with a field promotion receives the maximum amount of battle scars and dies you may promote another unit during the `Reinforcements` step of the campaign, up to your `Maximum Field Promoted Units` limit.

For Black Grail, as neither of your basic troops are eligible for promotion, you may purchase a Herald of Beelzebub who will receive a field promotion as above. At each point where you would normally receive an additional field promotion you may promote a herald you already have in your warband, or purchase one who will automatically receive the field promotion. Field promoted Heralds of Beelzebub count as basic troops for the purposes of the `Maximum Non-Basic Troops` field in the `Field Strength` Table. During games 11 and 12 you can have up to 5 field promoted units, so for these 2 games Heralds of Beelzebub are `0-5` instead of `0-4` for their unit limit.

For Court of the Seven-Headed Serpent, as neither of your basic troops are eligible for promotion, Yoke Fiends are upgraded to have Limited Potential.

### Supply Shortages

This campaign is set in the later part of the `nth Crusade`, when supply lines were broken and getting resupplied with anything apart from fresh bodies was a major issue.

No single units total cost (base ducat cost + equipment) may ever exceed 1/4 of your warbands `Threshold Value` per the `Field Strength` table. 

No single unit may have more than 200% of its Ducat value in equipment. For example, a 30 Ducat model may have up to 60 Ducats of equipment. Where models have equipment granted as part of their puchase cost (`Yeoman`'s bolt action rifle, `Annoited Heavy Infantry`'s Reinforced Armour and Infernal Brand) the value of this equipment should be subtracted from the models base Ducat cost and added to the 200% allowance for equipment.
